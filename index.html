        <p>Hello there, my name is Nicholas Ruppert, and I'm currently living in Tecumseh, Michigan, learning web development and coding. I am thrilled at the chance to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take on new challenges with modern, adaptable solutions.</li>
        <li>Connect with the greater World around me, and the great minds shaping it.</li><!-- Created an ordered list for the things I'm hoping to accomplish, and in what order -->
        <li>Help develop a smarter, brighter future for everyone.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>About Nicholas</h2>
        <p>I've always enjoyed and held a deep respect for the written word. Biographies on great people help shed light on why they took the actions they did, and historical accounts can help us better understand where we've come from, and what we've overcome.</p><!-- This is basically rinse/repeat for code, but I enjoy reading, and I appreciate you reading this. You're doing great in life, keep your head up!-->
        <p>Just as the pen has written our past, code will surely write out future. I have chosen to learn software engineering with the goal of helping and collaborating with others, in the hopes of writing the next chapter in human existence.</p>
