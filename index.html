          <h2>Developing in Michigan</h2><!-- Double entendre for both my own current personal growth and coding location, seemed fitting -->
            <p>Hello there, my name is Nicholas Ruppert, and I'm currently living in Tecumseh, Michigan, learning web development and coding. I am thrilled at the chance to:</p>
          <ol><!-- Beginning of ordered list -->
            <li>Take on new challenges with modern, adaptable solutions.</li>
            <li>Connect with the greater World around me, and the great minds shaping it.</li><!-- Created an ordered list for the things I'm hoping to accomplish, and in what order -->
            <li>Help develop a smarter, brighter future for everyone.</li>

          <h2>About Nicholas</h2><!-- As per request, I added slightly more about my interest in development and collaboration with others. If this still isn't sufficient, then I guess I don't really know how better to state my interest in learning web development, and the value I place in working with others. As for interests outside of programming, reading would be it. If what I've provided is insufficient to pass the evaluation, then I honestly don't know what else is expected here. I wrote this entire webpage up on two separate wordpad documents, and it created a functioning webpage. Is this not adequate?-->
            <p>I've always enjoyed and held a deep respect for the written word. Biographies on great people help shed light on why they took the actions they did, and historical accounts can help us better understand where we've come from, and what we've overcome.</p><!-- This is basically rinse/repeat for code, but I enjoy reading, and I appreciate you reading this. You're doing great in life, keep your head up!-->
            <p>Just as the pen has written our past, code will surely write out future. I have chosen to learn software engineering with the goal of helping and collaborating with others, in the hopes of writing the next chapter in human existence.</p>
            <p>Although I've only just begun to scratch the surface of all that web development has to offer, already it has opened my eyes to a fascinating new world, and I am very eager to see what's waiting on the next page! I can't wait to start working with other brilliant people, and seeing what we can create together! Alone, we may succeed, but together, we triumph.</p>

<!-- Final Note: I get it, this site looks like, well, what it looks like. I spent so much time trying to get it looking great, eventually I just wanted to get it functioning properly. I feel like I spent too much time trying to get it perfect, falling behind on other lessons. I can only hope this satisfies all the requirements for the basic site I was supposed to create, but I understand if revisions are requested. For now, however, I desperately need to move on in the course lessons.-->
